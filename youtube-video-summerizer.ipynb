TRANSLATED SUMMARY IS GIVEN BELOW:\n \nफिर भी यह निराश होने का साधारण तथ्य नहीं है जो बहुत मायने रखता है, सच्ची समस्या तब उत्पन्न होती है जब हमारी निराशा को दूर करने का कोई अवसर नहीं होता है, जलन केवल तभी विषाक्त होती है जब इस पर तेजी से और पूरी तरह से चर्चा नहीं की जा सकती है, शायद हमने कोशिश की थी समझाएं कि क्या गलत था, लेकिन हम कहीं नहीं पहुंचे या अधिक सूक्ष्मता से कहें तो हम तथाकथित छोटी-छोटी बातों पर हंगामा करने के लिए अयोग्य महसूस कर सकते थे और इसलिए कुछ भी नहीं कहा, भले ही हमारी गहराई में छोटी-छोटी बातें हमारे लिए बहुत मायने रखती थीं और हमारे साथी के साथ बहुत अन्याय हो सकता था। हम अपनी संवेदनाओं को स्वीकार करना भूल गए हैं, भले ही हमने उनके कारण नाराजगी का एक स्थिर बोझ विकसित किया हो, इस तरह के दबे हुए गुस्से से जो कुछ होता है वह कुछ ऐसा है जिसे केवल अरुचि के लिए गलत समझा जा सकता है, हम अब उनका जन्मदिन मनाने के लिए इतने उत्सुक नहीं हैं, हम यौन ध्यान को रोकते हैं जब वे किसी कमरे में चलते हैं तो हम ऊपर नहीं देखते हैं, यह समय और परिचितता का सामान्य प्रभाव लग सकता है, लेकिन यह ऐसी कोई बात नहीं है, यह ठंडे गुस्से का सबूत है, हम अपना गुस्सा और सम्मान करते हैं और जब हम कर सकते हैं तो इसके खतरनाक प्रभावों को खत्म करना शुरू कर देते हैं। उस विशिष्ट जकड़न को पहचानें जो हताशा और क्रोध हमारी भावनाओं पर हावी हो सकती है, हम कभी भी लोगों से दूर नहीं जाते हैं, हम केवल उन पर क्रोधित होते हैं और फिर भूल जाते हैं कि हम अपने साथी के लिए अपने सहज उत्साह को परिष्कृत करने के लिए हैं, हमें अपने दबे हुए संकट का सटीक रूप से पता लगाने की आवश्यकता है। हमें खुद को कुछ चीजों के बारे में वैध रूप से परेशान होने की अनुमति देनी होगी जिन्होंने हमें दुखी किया है और जब तक हमें इसकी आवश्यकता है तब तक उन्हें ठीक से उठाया है जिससे हमें स्वीकार्य और मूल्यवान महसूस हो सके एक अच्छे जोड़े को नियमित अवसरों की अनुमति देनी चाहिए जब प्रत्येक व्यक्ति बिना किसी मुठभेड़ के ऐसा कर सके। विपक्षी दूसरे से बड़ी या छोटी घटनाओं की कहानियाँ सुनने के लिए कहते हैं जिनमें उन्हें हाल ही में निराश या निराश महसूस हुआ है, यह कहने की आवश्यकता नहीं है कि हम तुरंत यह नहीं समझ सकते हैं कि कोई दी गई चीज़ हमारे साथी के लिए इतनी मायने क्यों रखती है, लेकिन ऐसा नहीं है इस अभ्यास का उद्देश्य केवल साथी को यह बताना है कि वे जो कुछ भी करते हैं हम उसकी परवाह करते हैं, यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए कि हमारी इच्छा कभी प्रभावित न हो, इस प्रकार की स्वच्छता अनुष्ठान सप्ताह में एक या दो बार भी हो सकती है यदि जोड़े बहुत अधिक बार आवश्यकता को अनदेखा करें क्योंकि वे बहादुरी के अनुचित बोझ के तहत काम करते हैं, वे मानते हैं कि उन चीजों के बारे में शिकायत करना नहीं देखा जा सकता है जो छोटी होने का आभास देती हैं और इसलिए अपनी परेशानियों के बारे में तब तक चुप रहते हैं जब तक कि यह संभव नहीं हो जाता। समझदार जोड़ों से प्रेम करने के लिए उन्हें यह पता होना चाहिए कि किसी भी बात को विस्तार से बताने के लिए कभी भी इतनी छोटी नहीं होनी चाहिए कि किसी एक शब्द या घटना के बारे में मैराथन बातचीत में अंततः जो दांव पर लगा है, वह पूरे रिश्ते का भाग्य हो सकता है, यह बिल्कुल भी मूर्खतापूर्ण नहीं हो सकता है एक पूरी शाम यह समझने के लिए समर्पित करें कि एक दिन पहले नाश्ते में हमने जिस तरह से उन्हें रेडी शब्द कहा था, उससे एक साथी चुपचाप बेहद परेशान क्यों हो गया था या सूटकेस में एक ट्रेन के बारे में एक हल्के से अजीब किस्से पर हंसने में थोड़ा धीमा था, वह आभार जो होगा उन्हें समझने के इस तरह के प्रयास से प्राप्त होने वाले प्रवाह का प्रतिफल अगली बार तब मिलेगा जब हम परित्यक्त महसूस करेंगे क्योंकि वे जैतून पर वापस ढक्कन लगाना भूल गए थे या प्यार में शिकायत करने के लिए ईमेल के अंत में दूसरा चुंबन जोड़ना भूल गए थे, यह एक नेक काम है और सम्मानजनक कौशल उस शिकायत से बहुत दूर है जिसके साथ इसे कभी-कभी भ्रमित किया जाता है, अच्छी तरह से लक्षित और जल्दी से उठाए गए शिकायतों की विडंबना यह है कि उनका कार्य नकारात्मक से बहुत दूर है ईमानदारी एक प्रेम-संरक्षण तंत्र है जो हमारे साथी के बारे में प्रभावशाली और आनंददायक सभी चीजों को जीवित रखता है नियमित रूप से अपने छोटे-छोटे दुखों और छोटी-मोटी परेशानियों को व्यक्त करने से हम ऐसा महसूस करते हैं मानो हम अपने रिश्ते की दरार से बार्नाकल को हटा रहे हैं और यह सुनिश्चित कर रहे हैं कि हम अधिक खुशी और प्रशंसा के साथ एक प्रामाणिक और अप्रतिष्ठित भविष्य की ओर बढ़ेंगे।\n","output_type":"stream"}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"****Text To Speech****","metadata":{"id":"ZcO96TJ3ONkD"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install
